Comedy shows can be a great way to entertain people, make new friends, and build your brand as a performer. Here's a brief tutorial on how to put on an amazing show!

## 1. Find a Venue

`venueIsAwesome == true`

Scout your local area for breweries, wineries, theaters, or any area with a stage. Ask the owner or event coordinator if they are willing to host a comedy event. Ask them if they have the following equipment:

- [x] amplifier
- [ ] microphone
- [x] mic stand
- [ ] mic cord

If they do not have that equipment, you will have to rent or borrow it from a friend.

## 2. Book the Comedians

`numComics >= 3 && numComics <= 6`

Attend local open mics and see which comedians or funny. Network and followup with them on Instagram or email. Ask them how much time they can do, and if they are free to perform on your show. Suggested price points are as follows:

* 10 minutes: $20
* 20 minutes: $50
* 30 minutes: $100
* 60 minutes: $200

> Tip: If you don't have the budget to hire comedians, you can book comedians with less experience and encourage the audience to *donate tips* to be shared among comics.

## 3. Promote the Show

`showDate == 3/14/2024`

It's time to get the word out! Print out flyers, text your friends, purchase ads on Facebook and Instagram. 

> Tip: Use **Eventbrite** or **TicketMaster** to sell tickets ahead of time.
> Tip: Work out a deal with the venue where each ticket comes with a free beer or drink.

## 4. Showtime!

`audience >= 60`

Be on time and warm up the crowd with lots of energy. It's ok to be silly and **hacky** as the host. Your main job is to get the audience in a good mood for the first comic.
